# spark-spec

A test suite to document the behavior of the Spark engine.

## Goals

1. Create a test suite that's easier to read than the Spark source code.

2. Make it easier to identify what breaks when Spark versions change.

3. Augment the official documentation with working code snippets.

4. Create a ton of drama, [like the RubySpec project](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8821015).  Just kidding!
